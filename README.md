## Introduction

While my friends and I love setting personal improvement goals, we're terrible at holding each other accountable. Our text chains are hectic and there's no way we'll remember to send a check-in message on a daily basis. Enter Simpatico. 

For my final project in the Flatiron SE program, I built the base for a goal sharing app with a social networking component built in. (In this initial build, the shared goals are inherently competitive as opposed to collaborative, but collaborative goal functionality is in the works.)

To see the project in action, view the demo video below.
